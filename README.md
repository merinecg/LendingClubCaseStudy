# Lending Club Case Study

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting loan defaults using a dataset from a lending institution. It employs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key drivers of loan defaults and develops data-driven metrics to assess borrower risk.

## General Information
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

-If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
-If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

Use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## Dataset
The dataset includes variables such as loan amount, interest rate, debt-to-income ratio, employment length, and loan status and many more. It has been preprocessed for missing values and outliers.

## Conclusions
- Top Risk Indicators for Default such as :
- Longer-term loans.
- Higher Loan Amount
- Higher Installments
- High Interest Rates: Associated with high-risk borrowers.
- Debt to income ratio
- Loan Purpose: Small business.
- Low Annual Income and Employment Length


## Technologies Used
- Python: Data analysis and visualization. 
- Libraries: Pandas 2.2.2, NumPy 1.26.4, Matplotlib 3.8.4, Seaborn  0.13.2
- Visualization Tools: Bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
